I am a PhD candidate in machine learning at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/){:target="
\_blank"} as a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/){:target="
\_blank"}. My research interests span Xplainable AI, deep neural networks, generative adversarial networks and stochastic optimization techniques. My most recent work was focused on using convolutional neural networks to gain insight into how magnetism arises in 2-D materials. In essence, seeking an answer to the question of whether we can use filters of a trained algorithm to gain insight into an underlying process we may not fully understand.

Prior to Oxford, I attended Harvard College where I received my MSc in Computational Science and BA in Physics (Magna Cum Laude with Highest Honors). During this time I was fortunate to conduct research with Professor [Efthimios Kaxiras](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/kaxiras) and [Philip Kim](http://kim.physics.harvard.edu/) on feature engineering to predict materials properties and heterostructure design, respectively. Outside research I was deeply involved in community service with [Philips Brooks House Academy](http://pbha.org/) and running the [Harvard Africa Business and Investment Club](https://www.harvardafricabusiness.org/). 

My interests also include: AI in Africa, China-Africa relations, renewable technology, data science consulting, and investment management. In my spare time, if I ever find any, I enjoy playing soccer, running and traveling.
