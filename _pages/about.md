I am a PhD candidate in machine learning at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/){:target="
\_blank"} as a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/){:target="
\_blank"}. My research interests span Xplainable AI, deep neural networks, generative adversarial networks and stochastic optimization techniques.

Previously, I attended Harvard College where I received my MSc in Computational Science and BA in Physics (Magna Cum Laude with Highest Honors). During this time I was fortunate to conduct research with Professor [Efthimios Kaxiras](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/kaxiras) and [Philip Kim](http://kim.physics.harvard.edu/) on feature engineering to predict materials properties and heterostructure design, respectively.

In addition, I have interests in: AI in Africa, China-Africa relations, renewable technology, data science consulting, and investment management. In my spare time, if I ever find any, I enjoy playing soccer, running and traveling.
